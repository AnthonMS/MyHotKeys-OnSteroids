# MyHotKey-OnSteroids
### Welcome to MyHotKeys-OnSteroids. This is my take on creating a program for easily configuring hotkeys and shortcuts. Where your HotKeys are configured in json and your actions are written in Python. The fact that your actions are written in python, gives you full control to do whatever you want to, when a key or button is pressed down, up, held or any of the other event types available.
